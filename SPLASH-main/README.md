SPLASH - **S**ecure **P**roxy for **L**ive **A**udiovisual **SH**ell

SPLASH is a modern web proxy with a user interface similar to a terminal.

For a list of commands, run `help`.

You can also inject links by adding `/#inject={url}` after the base url

> [!TIP]
> SPLASH supports many common command hotkeys, such as `ctrl` + `c` for close proccess, and `ctrl` + `d` and `exit` for immediate exit. You may open an issue at any time to suggest more commands and hotkeys.

## Development

Use Vite: `npx vite`, `bunx vite`, or `deno run npm:vite` whichever floats your boat

## Deploy yourself

> [!NOTE]
> Deployment config files for each provider are included in this repo.

FAQ
---

> Q: What are `splash.guard.js` and `ghost.js`? Why are they obfuscated?

**A:** `splash.guard.js` is an on-demand obfuscation to prevent reading from certain filters, it is obfuscated as it cannot obfuscate itself and therefore could be detected without obfuscation. It is heavily based on [HTML-Guard](https://github.com/DosX-dev/HTML-Guard) by [DosX](https://github.com/DosX-dev). `ghost.js` is a custom anti-DeleDao system, and is obfuscator to, again, avoid detection and patching.

> Q: How can I get to games? Are there any?

**A:** Games you can view by typing `games`, however there are only like three as I am waiting until v2 to work on the game libary.

> Q: What do I do if I need help with something?

**A:** Either join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/n5AfXS5eTP) and open a support ticket (response time of <8 hours), or open an Issue here in the repo (response time of ~24 hours)
